# Breast Cancer Mutation Visualization Project
This repository contains a [d3.js](https://d3js.org) project, visualizing mutation signature distributions in breast cancer data, adapted from Figure 3A in Huang, Xiaoqing, Damian Wojtowicz, and Teresa M. Przytycka. "Detecting Presence Of Mutational Signatures In Cancer With Confidence." bioRxiv (2017): 132597.

The data was obtained from the [SignatureEstimation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Przytycka/index.cgi#signatureestimation) R package, developed by Huang, et al., leveraging signature data from [COSMIC](https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic) and breast cancer tumor data from [ICGC](https://dcc.icgc.org).

The visualization can be accessed at [http://kellermark.gitlab.io/brca-mutation-visualization/](http://kellermark.gitlab.io/brca-mutation-visualization/), a GitLab pages-hosted instance of the project.
